# TocasJS
**如果你在尋找中文文件，請參閱另一份「讀我.md」**

**NOTE: There's a lot of function are not writen in this document**

A lighter JQuery-like library, we made it on our own,

if you know JQuery, then you already know how to use TocasJS,

and it's supported more functions .. such as $.cookie(), and more ..

#Usage
```
$(Element)
```

#Supported Functions
##Core

###Each
Call function for each elements.
```
.each(Callback(Element, Index, Element))
```

###Eq
Jump to target element.
```
.eq(Index)
```

##Style
###Show
Turn css display to "X".
```
.show(Display[Optional])
```
for example:
```
.show('table-cell')
```

###Hide
Turn css to "display: none".
```
.hide()
```

###Toggle
Display or hide a element.
```
.toggle(Display[Optional])
```

###AddClass
Add a class or many classes.
```
.addClass(Class)
```
```
.addClass('test class-1 class-2 class-3')
```

###RemoveClass
Remove a class or many class, if class name is empty, we clean all of the classes.
```
.removeClass(Class)
```
```
.removeClass('tb tb-none')
```
```
.removeClass()    //Clean all of the classes.
```

###ToggleClass
Remove a class if it's already existed, otherwise add it.(multiple classes is not supported yet.)
```
.toggleClass(Class)
```

###HasClass
Is this class existed in the element?

It will return a true or false.(multiple classes is not supported yet.)
```
.hasClass(Class)
```

###CSSAnimation
**this function with [Animate.css](http://github.com/daneden/animate.css) is required.**
```
.cssAnimation(Animate, Time, Callback)
```
**BEWARE:** The "Time" doesn't mean the speed of the animation,

it means the milliseconds to callback when the animation ends.

for example:
```
.cssAnimate('fadeInDown', 3000, function(){ alert('Animation End!') })
```

##Events
###On
Trigger a handler when an event was happened.
```
.on(EventName, Handler)
```
for example:
```
.on('click keyup input', function(){alert('Here comes another world.')})
```

###One
Same as above, but only triggered once.
```
.one(EventName, Handler)
```

###Off
Remove a handler which has name or remove the whole event handlers
```
.off(EventName, Handler[Optional])
```
for example:
```
.off('click keyup input')
```
```
.off('paste', Test)
```

###Ready
Once it ready(DOMContentLoaded), we trigger the handler.
```
.ready(Callback)
```

##Others
###Cookie (jQuery does not support this function.)
Read or write, delete a cookie.
```
$.cookie(Name, Value, Options[Optional])
```
The following is the options that you can use:
```
{
  expires : 10,             //Days for expiration.      (default: 365 days)
  path    : '/',            //The path of cookie.       (default: '/')
  domain  : 'TeaMeow.com'   //The domain of the cookie. (default: none)
}
```
So you can set, read, and unset it like this:
```
$.cookie('Foo', 'bar', {expires: 30})  //Name a cookie with 30 days expiration.
$.cookie('Foo')                        //Get a cookie which is called 'Foo'
$.cookie('Foo', '', -1)                //Expires a cookie(another words: unset).
```

###Ajax
Get data without refresh page, **same usage as jQuery**.
```
$.ajax(Options)
```
The following is the options that you can use:
```
{
  async: true, 
  type: 'POST',       //Type of form. (GET, POST)
  data: Data,         //Data that you want to send.
  dataType: 'json',   //Type of result. (json, html, text, string)
  
  url: 'http://www.teameow.com/test.php',
  timeout: 10000,
  contentType: false,  //BEWARE: FALSE IS NOT SAME AS THE DEFAULT.
                       //(default: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8)
                       
  success: function(XHR.responseText, XHR)
  error:   function(XHR, XHR.responseText)
  headers: {'Connection': 'keep-alive'}
}
```
